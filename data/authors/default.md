### What I Do

I'm currently focused on:

- **Security Research**: Exploring new vulnerabilities and attack techniques
- **Capture The Flag (CTF)**: Participating in cybersecurity competitions to sharpen my skills
- **Personal Projects**: Building tools and documenting my learning journey
- **Knowledge Sharing**: Writing about cybersecurity topics and sharing insights with the community

### Technical Skills

My cybersecurity toolkit includes:

- **Penetration Testing**: Burp Suite, OWASP ZAP, Metasploit, Nmap
- **Digital Forensics**: Volatility, Autopsy, Wireshark
- **Scripting**: Python, Bash, PowerShell
