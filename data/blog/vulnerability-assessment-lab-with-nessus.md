summary: My journey's write-up on how to perform vulnerability assessment with
  Nessus. Discover how to set up a Windows 10 VM, run credentialed and
  non-credentialed scans, identify CVEs, analyse vulnerabilities, and implement
  effective remediation to enhance cybersecurity skills.

## 1. Introduction

In the cybersecurity world, understanding how to identify, assess, and remediate vulnerabilities is crucial for protecting systems and networks. Vulnerability scanning is a fundamental skill for security analysts and penetration testers, enabling them to uncover weaknesses before attackers can exploit them.

In this lab, I set up a Windows 10 virtual machine (VM) on VirtualBox and installed Nessus, a widely used vulnerability scanner. I performed both basic and credentialed scans, analysed vulnerabilities, tested vulnerable software, and developed remediation strategies. This hands-on lab enhanced my expertise in vulnerability management, problem-solving, and system hardening.

Key learning outcomes:

* Configured and executed Nessus vulnerability scans
* Conducted credentialed and non-credentialed scans
* Identified and analysed system and application vulnerabilities
* Developed remediation strategies to mitigate risks
* Practiced documenting findings and generating professional reports

## 2. Lab Setup

### Step 1: Install Windows 10 on VirtualBox.

1. Download the Windows 10 ISO from Microsoft (you can go to  Microsoft website and search for *Create Installation Media for Windows 10*, and remember to choose ISO format).
2. Create a new VM in VirtualBox:

* Name: Nessus
* OS Type: Windows 10
* Allocate sufficient RAM and disk space
* Mount the Windows 10 ISO and start the VM.

### Step  2: Step 2: Configure the Windows VM.
* First, disable automatic Windows updates and uninstall recent updates that might block scanning tools (to prevent interference with Nessus scans).
* Next, turn off the Windows firewall so Nessus can reach required services and perform credentialed scans.
* Then, Ensure the Nessus VM is on the same network as the target VM:
> VirtualBox → Devices → Network → Configured Network Settings → Host-only Adapter
* Use two command prompts to check IPs and test connectivity with ping:
`ipconfig
ping 192.168.x.x`
## 3. Installing and Configuring Nessus
### Step 1: Install Nessus
- Download the Nessus installer for Windows and complete the installation.
- Start the Nessus service and access the web interface.
### Step 2: Configure Basic Network Scan
- First, select Basic Network Scan.
- Next, in Settings, enter the name of the target machine, for example, Windows, and provide the IP address of the target.
- Then, in the Discovery settings, configure Scan Type as common ports (SSH, FTP, Telnet, SMTP) and protocols (TCP, ARP, ICMP).
- Following that, within the Assessment settings, set Scan Type as Default, with General Settings including Avoid false alarms ( increase risk of legitimate vulnerabilities), and Disable CGI scanning (Turn off common gateway interface CGI scripts). 
- In the Report settings ( the level of detail of the scan result), you can keep at default.
- After that, check the Credentials section ( help collect information about the installed software patch levels and system configurations that are critical for detecting vulnerabilities), leave it unchanged for now. For plugins, it is considered the location for the additional tools.
## 4. Running the Initial Scan
- First, within the Dashboard, run the basic scan on the target VM.
- After a while, the result will appear; however, since we did not use credential scan, we can only see the surface. In the result, we can notice that this remote host listens on ports 137 and 445.
> - For your information, port 445 vulnerabilities could allow exploits like WannaCry ransomware.
> - Open ports can be leveraged for man-in-the-middle attacks.

> → With Nessus, we can identify and address these issues quickly and take proactive steps to mitigate them and safeguard the network to prevent potential security breaches.
## 5. Configuring Credentialed Scans
> → Credentialed scans provide deeper insights into installed software, patch levels, and system configurations.
### Step 1: Add Credentials
- Now, using the Scan we just created, open the Credentials section, then expand Windows Credentials.
- Next, for the Authentication method, select Password, and fill in the username and password of the target machine.
### Step 2: Prepare the Windows VM
> → You might receive notifications indicating that the account used does not have the necessary privileges when running Scan, as the Non-default admin account is not auto-added to the local group admins and does not have appropriate rights to access all the system files and settings.

To address that:
- Go back to Windows VM, go to Start → Services → Remote Registry → Startup Type: Automatic
- Then, disable User Account Control prompts:
> - Go to Start → Change User Account Control settings → Drag it down to “Never Notify”.
 
> → This helps prevent user account control prompts from interrupting our scan.

- Next, edit the registry with administrator privileges to allow non-admin accounts to access administrative resources:
> - Open HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\System. 
> - Then, right-click the blank space on the right side of the screen → New → DWORD (32-bit) Value → It will create a new registry value that you can name “LocalAccountTokenFilterPolicy” → Double click and edit the properties → Change from 0 to 1.

> → This will enable the local account token filter policy, which allows non-administrator accounts to access administrative resources on the system.
### Step 3: Run Credentialed Scan
- Go back to Nessus and start the scan. We should now detect the vulnerabilities, with >40 vulnerabilities in this case, including missing patches and misconfigurations.

## 6. Testing Vulnerable Software
- Now, switch VM network to Bridged Adapter, so we can access to the internet to download vulnerable softwares.
- Install older software versions to simulate vulnerabilities:
>- You can download Older Google Chrome (Version 68.0.3440.84) through slimjet.com. After finishing installing, open Start menu, search for System Configuration, then uncheck Google updates. After restart, Google cannot update anymore. This helps preserve the vulnerability.
>- Then, using mcversion.net, download Minecraft with Log4j vulnerability (Version 1.18.1). In order to extract the Minecraft file, download vulnerable 7zip (Version 19.00) on Google. Next, use 7-zip to extract the server file, then open META INF → versions → Extract that 
- Go back to Nessus, perform an advanced scan, and detect vulnerabilities in these application.
> - After finishing scanning, we get a lot more information, and vulnerabilities. We can see multiple issues with Google Chrome, Microsoft Windows, Apache Log4j, 7-zip, and more. 

## 7. Reporting
- At this step, you can generate a Nessus report summarizing findings, vulnerability severity, and remediation steps. To create a report, click the Rport button at the top right screen.
- Reports help communicate risks clearly to stakeholders and guide security improvements.

## 8. Remediation
After scanning and analysing vulnerabilities, we begin our remediation steps:

- Ensure system out of security breaches by applying Windows updates and patches.

- Re-enable system protections such as the firewall and automatic updates.

- Remove vulnerable software (for example, Minecraft files, outdated Chrome, and 7-zip).

- Re-run Nessus to verify vulnerabilities have been mitigated.

**Result:** The system was secured, and no critical vulnerabilities remained.
## 9. Key takeaways
This lab gave me hands-on experience in configuring and running Nessus to uncover vulnerabilities in Windows systems, including credentialed scans and testing outdated software like Log4j. I learned how to analyse vulnerabilities, prioritize risks, and implement effective remediation strategies, such as patching and system hardening. Additionally, I gained practical skills in network configuration, safely managing firewall settings in a lab environment, and documenting findings in professional reports. Overall, this experience strengthened my problem-solving abilities and built confidence in applying vulnerability assessment techniques in real-world scenarios.
